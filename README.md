# OC_P3_Design-an-application-for-public-health

### Context:
The agency "Sant√© publique France" has launched a call for projects to find innovative ideas for applications related to food. You want to participate and propose an idea for an application.


### Mission
Process the dataset, by: Thinking about an application idea. Identifying variables that are relevant to future processing and necessary for your application idea. Cleaning the data by : Highlighting any missing values, with at least 3 processing methods appropriate for the variables involved, identifying and quantifying the possible outliers of each variable. Automating these processes to avoid repeating these operations.
Throughout the analysis, produce visualizations to better understand the data. Perform a univariate analysis for each variable of interest to summarize its behavior.
Confirm or refute hypotheses using multivariate analysis. Perform appropriate statistical tests to verify the significance of the results.
Justify your application idea. Identify arguments to justify the feasibility (or not) of the application based on the Open Food Facts data.
